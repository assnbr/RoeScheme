STIFFENED GAS
Stiffened Gas Equation of State

- This equation of state is based on the ideal gas law, to which a factor is added to reduce the compressibility.
- This EoS can represent liquid-like fluids in addition to gases.

""" Thermodynamic Properties of Stiffened Gas """

# Gama - adiabatic index [-]
# Cp - heat capacity at constant pressure [J/kg.K]
# p_inf - pressure representing the molecular attraction between molecules [Pa]
# e_sg - specific internal energy [J/kg]
# p_sg - absolute pressure [Pa]
# Grun_sg - First Gr√ºneisen coefficient for stiffened gas EoS [-]
